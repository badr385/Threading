Hello Guys,


I tried how to implement threads in python in order to understand how it s working. i used first this link. 

Credits : https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-concurrency/python-threading/

I used their examples first, by after i go a little bit far.By reading contents file first and replacing it by another customs contents on each three files i used.

Also i run for each functions their own threads.

I test it and it s working fine

I started python in order to save time on my work, also because it s more interesting to launch a script instead of doing the same task for 1 hour, you don't feel stupid at all :).

I will try upload more contents. I usually work on cisco devices.
