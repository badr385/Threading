Hello Guys,


I tried how to implement threads in python in order to understand how it s working. i used first this link. 

Credits : https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-concurrency/python-threading/

I used their examples by i go fat by reading contents file first and replacing them by another customs contenes on each three file i use.

Also i tried to understand how to lunch for each function their own threads.

Test it and it s working

I started python in order to save time on my work, also because it s more interesting to launch a script instead of doing the same task for 1 hour, you don't feel stupid at all :).

I will try upload more contents. I usually work on cisco devices
